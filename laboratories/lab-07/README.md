# Laboratory 7

## Task 1

> Description: Parallelize the path finding between two nodes in a graph.

This would seem like a typical fork/join problem. But that's not the case.
You see, the [accepting state](task1/MyRunnable.java#L22) doesn't provide any
feedback to parent states. So this is only a parallelized backtracking.
