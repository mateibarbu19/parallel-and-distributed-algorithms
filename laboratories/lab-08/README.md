# Laboratory 8

Since this was a introductory lab, most exercises were executed as described.
So this README contains no explanations.

The [compile_flags](compile_flags.txt) will come in useful if you are using
`clangd`.

## Task 1

> Description: Implement a ring algorithm using MPI.

Code sources:
[ex1](ex1)

## Task 2

> Description: Broadcast cast a random integer from process 0.

Code sources:
[ex2](ex2)

## Task 3

> Description: Distribute evenly an array from process 0 to all processes
> and let each of them process their respective chunk. At the end gather them.

## Task 4

> Description: Make a processes receive values form any other 3 processes.

## Task 5

> Description: Make a processes receive values with any tag from another
> process.
