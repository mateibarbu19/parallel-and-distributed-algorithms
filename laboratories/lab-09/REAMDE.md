# Laboratory 9

All the solutions were discussed in the lectures and in the laboratory
explanations.

## Task 1

> Description: Implement an analogue of MPI_Reduction, reducing a set of value
> to their sum (using prefix sums). The reduced value will be found in the first
> process.

## Task 2

> Description: Implement an analogue of MPI_Scan, reducing a set of value
> to their sum (using prefix sums). The scanned value will be found in the first
> process.

## Task 3

> Description: Implement an analogue of MPI_Broadcast, broadcasting a value to a
> set of processes.

## Task 4

> Description: Implement a pipeline polynomial function.

## Task 5

> Description: Implement a pipeline sorting algorithm.

## Task 6

> Description: Implement the rank sort algorithm.
