# Test 1

In this folder I have save my solutions for the first practical test.

[The old file](test_1_old.cpp) contains the solution submitted for correction.
It uses only C-style pointers.

[The new solutions](test_1_new.cpp) is a improved version using "smart"
pointers.

Note: My solution was graded 9/10 because it uses busy-waiting. This problem can
be reduced to Readers-writers with only one reader. So it could be solved with
two semaphores without busy-waiting.
